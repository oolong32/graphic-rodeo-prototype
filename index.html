      <p class="lead">
        By making the work visible through publication a shared benefit arises.
      </p>

      <h2 id="method">Method</h2>
      <p>
        The Students get in touch with different, experimental design
        methods. The Workshop is divided into three differnt working steps:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Impression: 
          elementary introduction</li>
        <li>Expression: 
          experimental phase</li>
        <li>Modulation:</li>
          form and content melt to the result</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The working steps interlock with each other. At the end of each step, a critique of the results takes
        place in the plenary. The complexity of the content increases along the
        working steps.
      </p>

      <h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
